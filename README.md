My system config files

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinjpickard/.dotfiles/osx/.dotfiles/osxsetup.sh > setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`

This script will setup a MacOS system with my preferred shell settings. This includes installing Vim, Powerline, FISH, Homebrew, python, Vundle, powerline fonts, NERDTree, and pulls all config files for FISH, BASH, etc.
